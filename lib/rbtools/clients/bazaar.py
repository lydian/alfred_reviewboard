        The 'revisions' argument is a list of revisions as specified by the

        since the user can use SCM-native syntaxes such as "r1..r2" or "r1:r2".
        SCMTool-specific overrides of this method are expected to deal with
        such syntaxes.

        This will return a dictionary with the following keys:
            'base':        A revision to use as the base of the resulting diff.
            'tip':         A revision to use as the tip of the resulting diff.
            'parent_base': (optional) The revision to use as the base of a
                           parent diff.

        These will be used to generate the diffs to upload to Review Board (or
        print). The diff for review will include the changes in (base, tip],
        and the parent diff (if necessary) will include (parent, base].

        If a single revision is passed in, this will return the parent of that
        revision for 'base' and the passed-in revision for 'tip'.

        If zero revisions are passed in, this will return the current HEAD as
